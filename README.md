# Machine Learning Specialization — Applied Labs

This repository contains my completed programming exercises from the [Coursera Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction), taught by Andrew Ng and developed by DeepLearning.AI in collaboration with Stanford Online.

Each notebook applies machine learning concepts through hands-on coding in Python. The labs are designed as structured exercises to practice implementing algorithms, interpreting outputs, and documenting results. They build foundational skills for working with real-world ML problems while reinforcing theory from the lectures.

The files are named using the format `C<course_number>_W<week_number>_<Topic>.ipynb`. For example, `C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb` contains the Week 2 lab from Course 1 on linear regression, while `C2_W4_Decision_Tree_with_Markdown.ipynb` walks through building a decision tree classifier.

## Why This Matters

These labs show my ability to take a concept, code it, test it, and explain it clearly. They reflect skills that apply directly to professional data science and ML workflows—such as working in Python, structuring notebooks for reproducibility, and applying algorithms to structured datasets.

While the exercises are educational in scope, they provide a solid technical foundation and demonstrate that I can quickly learn and apply new machine learning techniques in practice.
