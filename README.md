# Machine Learning Specialization — Labs

*Stanford Online & DeepLearning.AI via Coursera (Instructor: Andrew Ng)*

## Course Context

This repository contains my completed programming labs from the **Machine Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng, offered jointly by **Stanford Online** and **DeepLearning.AI**, completed in **2025**.
The labs are guided, hands-on exercises that focus on correct implementation, interpretation, and clear documentation of core ML methods.

**Tech Stack:** Python · NumPy · scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Jupyter Notebook

## Project Highlights

* **C1W2 — Linear Regression** — Implement gradient descent and evaluate a univariate/multivariate linear model; visualize loss vs. iterations.
* **C1W3 — Logistic Regression** — Build a binary classifier, plot decision boundaries, and assess performance with appropriate metrics.
* **C2W1 — Neural Networks (Binary Classification)** — Implement forward/backward propagation for a small MLP; compare learned decision boundaries to logistic regression.
* **C2W2 — Neural Networks (Multiclass)** — Extend the MLP to multiclass outputs; train and evaluate accuracy on a labeled dataset.
* **C2W3 — Applying ML in Practice** — Pipeline mindset: split data, scale features, regularize/tune, and validate; compare models with simple, readable plots.
* **C2W4 — Decision Tree (Information Gain)** — Construct a decision tree with entropy/information gain and explain splits in markdown.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Translating ML theory into **working Python/Numpy code** and clean, reproducible notebooks.
* **Model training & evaluation**: loss curves, decision boundaries, accuracy and related metrics.
* **Neural network fundamentals**: forward/backprop for binary and multiclass tasks.
* **Practical ML workflow**: train/validation split, feature scaling, simple tuning, and comparisons.
* Communicating results with **clear markdown explanations** and simple visualizations.

## How to Run

Open any notebook in Jupyter and run top-to-bottom:

```bash
# optional: create a venv
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter

jupyter notebook C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb
```

## What to Look For

* **Readable, self-contained notebooks**: each lab sets up data, trains a model, visualizes results, and explains takeaways.
* **Correctness and clarity over flash**: straightforward implementations, stepwise plots, and concise commentary.
* **Progression** from linear → logistic → neural nets → applied workflow → decision trees, showing breadth across core supervised methods.
