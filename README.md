## Course Context

This repository contains my lab implementations from the Stanford Online & DeepLearning.AI **Machine Learning Specialization**, completed in 2025.
The program covered the foundational algorithms and practices of modern machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and key applications such as anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and reinforcement learning.
It emphasized both theoretical understanding and hands-on application using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
The final **verified certificate** is included in this repository.

**Tech Stack:** Python · NumPy · scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Jupyter Notebook
